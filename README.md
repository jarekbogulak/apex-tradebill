# Codex Custom Prompts

User inputs for Codex custom prompts:
- `/constitution`
- `/specify`
- `/plan`
with additional project instructions for prompt files located in `.codex/prompts/`.

1. /constitution: Create principles for a trading companion app (tradebill) for Apex Omni DEX day traders focused on financial data integrity, risk management, code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency for day-traders, and performance requirements such as low-latency execution and high reliability. Emphasize crypto-grade security and sercrets protection. Include governance for how these principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices throughout development of the Apex Tradebill mobile app.
2. /specify: Develop Apex TradeBill, a trading companion app for Apex Omni DEX day traders. The app’s purpose is to provide a fast, portable, and reliable way to calculate position sizing, manage trade risk, and evaluate trade opportunities directly from a mobile device. Its core function is to let traders enter a potential trade idea and instantly see the calculated risk, required position size, and risk-to-reward profile, all powered by live market data. When a user launches Apex TradeBill, they will be prompted to enter or select key trade inputs: account size, trade direction (long or short), entry price, stop price, and target price. The entry price will default to the real-time trade value fetched from the API. Additional risk parameters such as multipliers, and percent risk can be configured upfront or adjusted through a settings menu. Crucially, the app will calculate the Average True Range (ATR) dynamically using real-time price data pulled directly from the Apex Omni API to determine a safe place to put stop losses to avoid being stop hunted or stopped out of a trade due to a tight stop loss. Default multiplier setting is 1.5. For a more conservative stop loss use 2 and for a tighter stop loss use 1. This ensures that all volatility-based calculations are current and adapt automatically as market conditions change. Based on the user’s inputs and live market data, the app will display critical trade outputs in real time. These include the number of crypto to buy, the total cost of the position, the trade’s exact risk value, and a clear risk-to-reward profile. The main interface will present this information in a structured, intuitive layout: Inputs Panel for entering trade details, Outputs Panel showing calculated trade size, cost, and risk, Risk Visualization to illustrate stop-loss versus target scenarios, and Trade History to store and review recent calculations. The rationale behind Apex TradeBill is to eliminate the friction of relying on static tools and manual calculations in fast-moving markets. By combining instant risk management calculations with real-time volatility analysis, the app gives traders sharper decision-making power at the moment of opportunity. In its initial phase, Apex TradeBill will focus on delivering feature parity for essential trade preparation functions—ensuring accuracy and speed—before expanding to advanced features such as multi-leg trades, saved strategies, or execution integrations.
3. /plan: The application utilizes React Native with Expo (a universal app with web capabilities) for the frontend, while Node.JS with the Apex Omni OpenApi-Node.JS-SDK is employed for the backend. Use context7 for the official Expo documentation. The official API documentation is accessible at https://api-docs.omni.apex.exchange
